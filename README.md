In this assignment, I created two python scripts to update and extract information from a food hygiene rating dataset using MongoDB. 

### Update Database
First, I updated the database by adding a new establishment, removing any unwanted establishments, and converted values to specific datatypes. 

### Data Analysis
The following questions were answered by performing data queries and building an aggregate pipeline
1. Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?
2. Which establishments in London have a Rating Value greater than or equal to 4?
3. What are the top 5 establishments with a Rating Value of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added (Penang Flavours)?
4. How many establishments in each Local Authority have a hygiene score of zero, sorted from highest to lowest?
